/*
Step 1:  Create the <form> html tag;
Step 2:  Create the <mat-form-field> html tag;
step 3:  Create <input> html tag
step 4:  all text is created via material directives within the tag

<textaria> and <input> are the tags that are used within <mat-form-field>
Directives:
For just a regular form input:
normal Placeholder text within form:  <input matInput placeholder="placeholder text">
NOTE:  you can use other html tags to change the way the placeholder text is placed, such as <textaria>

FOR ERROR STUFF:
err, gonna have to look this shit up.  a lot of directive usage
but you use <mat-hint> and <mat-error>

Checkbox:  use <mat-checkbox> tag
